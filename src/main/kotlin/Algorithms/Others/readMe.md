<b>Bubble Sort</b>: Simple and easy to understand, but inefficient for large lists.<br>
<b>Selection Sort</b>: Similar to bubble sort in complexity, but with fewer swaps.<br>
<b>Insertion Sort</b>: Efficient for small data sets and often used in practice for its simplicity.<br>
<b>Merge Sort</b>: Efficient, stable, and uses a divide-and-conquer approach.<br>
<b>Quick Sort</b>: Efficient for large data sets, but can have poor performance in the worst-case scenario.<br>
<b>Heap Sort</b>: Efficient and often used for its consistent O(n log n) time complexity.<br>
<b>Counting Sort</b>: Efficient for a limited range of integers, but requires extra space.<br>
<b>Radix Sort</b>: Efficient for integers, but less practical for general-purpose sorting.<br>
<b>Bucket Sort</b>: Efficient for uniformly distributed data, but requires knowledge of the data distribution.
